# To Do

## High Priority
* Determine the cause of the heavy delay when putting the spiders to sleep.

## Medium Priority
* Enable the script to become daemonized.
* Try to determine the title of the domain based on the titles of its pages.
* Detect forms in the HTML, save the action= and the input fields to the pages table.

## Low Priority
* Begin work on WebCrawler site front-end. (Requires database redesign to be complete.)
* Enable notes to be stored regarding interesting information for pages and onions.
* Take note of important header information, such as server type.

## In Process

## Complete
