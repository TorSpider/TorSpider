# To Do

## Bugs
* SpiderStats reveals that there are more online sites than we've even scanned so far: `So far, TorSpider has scanned 43 (1.27%) of the 3,394 urls it has discovered. Of the scanned sites, 53 are known to be active. TorSpider has found 25 direct links between these sites.` Why is this happening?

## High Priority
* Update the script to use ORM and Flask.
* Separate the backend code from the spider code.

## Medium Priority
* Find a secure way to allow access to remote spiders.
* Create a force-directed graph map of the known darknet.

## Low Priority
* Enable the script to become daemonized.
* Try to determine the title of the domain based on the titles of its pages.
* Begin work on WebCrawler site front-end. (Requires database redesign to be complete.)
* Enable notes to be stored regarding interesting information for pages and onions.

## In Process
* Optimize the process top to bottom.

## Complete
