# To Do

## High Priority
* Determine the cause of the heavy delay when putting the spiders to sleep.
* Include [sshtunnel](https://github.com/pahaz/sshtunnel) to enable access to remote servers. You can set up the server like [so](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235040/how-do-i-create-a-ssh-user-that-can-only-access-mysql) to prevent the public account from having any additional rights in the system.

## Medium Priority
* Enable the script to become daemonized.
* Try to determine the title of the domain based on the titles of its pages.
* Detect forms in the HTML, save the action= and the input fields to the pages table.
* Learn to use [VivaGraph.js](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS) to create a map of the darknet.

## Low Priority
* Begin work on WebCrawler site front-end. (Requires database redesign to be complete.)
* Enable notes to be stored regarding interesting information for pages and onions.
* Take note of important header information, such as server type.

## In Process

## Complete
* Create a SpiderStats script to gather information about what has been found.
* Close the connection after every update. Perhaps this will prevent some of the blocking and slow-downs.
