# To Do

## High Priority
* Update the script to use ORM and Flask.
* Separate the backend code from the spider code.
* Optimize the process top to bottom.

## Medium Priority
* Include [sshtunnel](https://github.com/pahaz/sshtunnel) to enable access to remote servers. You can set up the server like [so](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235040/how-do-i-create-a-ssh-user-that-can-only-access-mysql) to prevent the public account from having any additional rights in the system.
* Improve the VisualWeb.py map by adjusting colors and line lengths, and by including the name of the site above its dot.

## Low Priority
* Enable the script to become daemonized.
* Try to determine the title of the domain based on the titles of its pages.
* Begin work on WebCrawler site front-end. (Requires database redesign to be complete.)
* Enable notes to be stored regarding interesting information for pages and onions.
* Take note of important header information, such as server type.
