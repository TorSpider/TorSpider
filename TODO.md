# To Do

## Bugs

## High Priority
* Replace `merge_urls` with `merge_action`, since it does the same thing but better. Rename `merge_action` to `merge_urls`.

## Medium Priority
* Find a secure way to allow access to remote spiders.
* Create a force-directed graph map of the known darknet.
* Enable the script to become daemonized.

## Low Priority
* Try to determine the title of the domain based on the titles of its pages.
* Begin work on WebCrawler site front-end. (Requires database redesign to be complete.)
* Enable notes to be stored regarding interesting information for pages and onions.

## In Process

## Complete
* Update the script to use ORM and Flask.
* Separate the backend code from the spider code.
