''' TorSpider â€“ A script to explore the darkweb.
    -------------------by Christopher Steffen---
    
    Usage: TorSpider.py [Seed URL]
    
        If no Seed URL is provided, TorSpider will begin scanning wherever
        it left off last time, then will re-scan all known URLs from the top
        of the list.
    
    --------------------------------------------
    
    TorSpider will explore the darkweb to discover as many onion sites as
    possible, storing them all in a database along with whatever additional
    information can be found. It will also store data regarding which sites
    connected to which other sites, allowing for some relational mapping.
    
    The database generated by TorSpider will be accessible via a secondary
    script which will create a web interface for exploring the saved data.
